# hello-world

I live in the Falls Road area overlooking the football fields. My name is Prakash Chakraborty. I'm 30 years old. Every morning I wake up and drink a large cup of coffee. I take two sugars and lactose free milk. I then apply a charcoal facial mask to cleanse the toxins from the previous day, Then I get ready to face the world. There's an idea of a Prakash Chakraborty, even though our paths may cross and you may find that we have similar interests, behind this mask, I simply do not exist.
